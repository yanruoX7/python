PythonShootGame
===============

A simple shoot game by python


This project only include two simple .py files: 

  mainGame.py：the initialization and main loop of the game
  
  gameRole.py: class of the game role
  
  
To run this game, first install python 3.x, then install the corresponding version of pygame.
After that, double click the mainGame.py, you can play it.

修改了一点地方，现在能够在python3上运行了。具体进入cmd，输入python game.py后回车即可。
